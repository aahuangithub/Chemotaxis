<h1>HOW CHEMOTAXIS WORKS</h1> 
<p>Each Bacteria consists 3 parts:
<ul>
 <li>a head (arc) </li><li>body (circle)</li> <li>tail (line)</li> 
</ul>
 The head indicates which direction the bacteria will travel, the tail where it was last. The head holds a color value. The color has 3 parts to it: <ul><li>id (red)</li> <li>variability (green)</li> <li>rotation (blue)</li></ul> <strong>All these properties are inherited from generation to generation</strong></p> <p>The id is the bacteria's assigned number compared to the entire population. The redder the bacteria is, the later created it's lineage was.   <br /> The variability indicates how far the maximum step distance and rotation can change in between generations. The greener it is, the larger the difference between parent and child. The variability factor will occasionally change by 1 between generations.   <br /> The rotation is simply the direction the bacteria will travel. This can change by up to 90 degrees depending on variability.</p> <p>A generation takes place every <strong>2 seconds.</strong> After two seconds, each parent will die depending on it's distance from the food (survival rates decrease from 90% at center to 33% to 12% to 0%). The program begins with 75 bacteria, and 10 can be added with each right click.</p>
